I’m not sure how to access this data and get a random sample of about 50 prices from each data set, so let’s talk further about that! Ideally, the random sample should be formatted in a graph that shows some sort of distribution (like scatter plot or bar graph!) I’m not sure of the extent for Jupyter graphs/visuals, but if it could have the option to display the 2019 graph only, 2022 graph only, and both at the same time, that would be awesome here!]\n",

    "In most cases, when we look at two different data sets to compare, there may be some overlapping points. For example, even though the overall graph shows the price of avocados in 2022 being greater than the price of avocados in 2019, we still see some points in the 2022 graph that are less than points of the 2019 graph. If there is a lot of overlap, looking at a visual or single calculated value may not be enough!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it may be best to use a two sample t-test. A two sample t-test is a statistical test that can help us compare the means, or average, of the two dataset. T-tests have a specific criteria that the data must abide by to work:\n",

    "independent (the data do not affect each other)\n",

    "Keep in note, we are using samples of the entire population. That is why we can use a t-test! Otherwise we would use a different test. In most cases, you will not be able to collect data about an entire population, so t-tests are incredibly useful here!\n",

    "At the end, we will receive a p-value. That p-value is compared to the probability “limit,” helping us determine if we are able to reject our null hypothesis. The “limit” is called the significance level, denoted as α. Typically, α is set to 0.05, but it can vary depending on the field of study. Essentially, α = 0.05 just means there is a 5% risk that we reject the null hypothesis (or conclude that there is a significant change) even though there is actually no difference between the means (null is actually true!). So in the context of avocados, if we have a p-value that is lower than α = 0.05, we can assert with 95% confidence that the prices of avocados from 2019 and 2022 are not the same. That is, there is a 5% chance that the prices are the same, even though our calculations state otherwise. For this problem, let’s set our α = 0.05. "
