    "- A **markdown cell**, such as this one, contains text. \n",
    "- A **code cell** contains code in Python, a programming language that we will be using with all of our data science modules in this class. You can select any cell by clicking it once.\n",
    "    - Code cells can also contain code in other languages like Julia, or R: both of which can also be used in data analysis\n",

    "### Results and Outputs of a Cell\n",
    "When you run a code cell, a number of things can happen, depending on the type and contents of the cell:\n",
    "1. If the cell is a markdown cell, the text will be rendered according to the structure (_Markdown_, _HTML_, etc.)\n",
    "2. If the cell is a code cell, the result of the last line in the cell will be shown\n",
    "    - This output may be text, a number, a picture, or a visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "If a code cell is running, you will see an asterisk (\\*) appear in the square brackets to the left of the cell. Once the cell has finished running, a number will replace the asterisk and any output from the code will appear under the cell.\n",
