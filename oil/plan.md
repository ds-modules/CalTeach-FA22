# Oil
> [Google Doc Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xeBnLyTssse8Y7Azx0quz9_HGkDfTQ-MxriLV6O4CNQ/edit)

As our current society starts to adapt to using different fossil fuel alternatives such as electric vehicles and solar energy, the oil industry is getting affected as well.
(The teacher can ask the students if they have any experience with using crude oil and solar energy like in solar panels, and even if they use an electric vehicle or have seen the number of electric vehicles around where they live. Just as a form to get the students to become interested in the topic, as well as making it more relatable to the students themselves.)

The question here we want to know is, because of our growing modern society, will the oil production of the US increase, decrease, or just stay the same? Use the scatterplot graph to look at and predict to answer this question.
(This is just to get the students to start engaging in the assignment by having them collaborate with each other, and with those around them, it is not necessary for them to form groups, the main point of this step is just for the students share their thoughts and views when answers this question with each of the graphs).

(To Jonathan: Is it possible to take the data in this link to make a scatter plot graph in the Juypter Notebook?)

In the box provided, give a brief prediction on what the future trend will be like for the graph, specifically if the trend is going to increase, decrease, or stay the same. Along with a reason for your choice.





Below is a link to the US timeline regarding the significant US events that took place that may have attributed to the trends in the previous years.

After taking a look at the timeline and the events that were on it, would you like to make any changes regarding your first prediction about the different graph data? If so, write your new prediction along with your reasoning, and if not, write why you like to maintain your initial prediction and how the timeline may support it.






Because the plots between each year and each month are not completely linear, we can draw regression lines between each year to understand where the graph is really going.

Regression lines: Also known as lines of best fit are lines that are linear estimates between variables on a graph to describe the trend of the graph.

A regression line can be formed between the two variables for each type of graph, though it is not impossible for some graphs, when they have a weak correlation with each other, the line can’t be immediately noticeable.

       

The graphs show that the plots have a weak correlation because the plots are not really grouped together to form a trend, showing that the variables are not related to each other to have a strong dependent relationship. 
(Have the students discuss with each other if the graphs would have a positive or negative regression line for each of the graphs before they see the graphs with the regression lines. This is so that they can start thinking about how the trend would look like, as well as to show them that scatterplots with weak correlation can have regression lines that are hard to see at first glance and possibly confusing to them.)

Even though each of the graphs has a weak correlation, one can make a regression line between the variables, and if one were to do so, it would probably look like this:
     

With linear regression lines in place, it can be seen that the graph on the left has a negative weak correlation and the one on the right has a weak positive correlation. You can tell from the r-value (r^2) because that value, which ranges from 0 to 1, is closer to 0, showing that the variables have a weak correlation with each other.  

And the same thing can be done with graphs that have a strong correlation between each of the variables, the main difference is that the graphs in this case would have points that are more closely next to each other, forming a very noticeable linear relationship.
(For this step, let the students answer the question of what the slope would look like in this case, more specifically, if the line would be positive or negative, just like with the graphs with the weak correlation.)

          

Since the relationship can be more easily seen since the correlation is stronger than in the previous two graphs, it can also be easily inferred that one of the variables here has a strong dependent relationship with the other variable. Another noticeable detail to notice here is that the r-value is closer to 1 this time, proving that the variables have a strong correlation with each other.

      

Now for the next exercise, draw a regression line between each of the years, using the months as scatter plots for each of the data graphs from the first exercise so that we can see the trends between each of the years, forming a trend graph for the data set.
(This is will be the most time-consuming part of the curriculum, so it is strongly recommended that students be given enough time to complete this step)

(To Jonathan: for this exercise, can we have students draw a regression line in the Juypter Notebooks between each year interval.)

After forming a trend graph for the data, we now going to take a look at the trends that are taking place, and possibly notice if there is a pattern going on. If you see a pattern going on, take note of it, and use that to make a new prediction or to support the initial hypothetical prediction you had before. 





Discussion among students after completing the exercise:
In what other scenarios can reading graphs or data be applicable in real-life situations? Are there any scenarios where you might envision yourself doing this in the future?
(One example is an investment if the students want to learn how to invest in the future to gain a financial future, they would probably need to learn how to read graphs and make predictions based on events that are taking place.)

(Note: It would be best if the students’ responses were recorded as much as possible, doesn’t have to be deeply descriptive for the students to type in somewhere along with their work, but possibly a short response for each discussion exercise. Maybe if there was a platform where they all can write down their thoughts, like a community board, but just for the class.)
